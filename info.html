                <p>My name is Matt Mallen and I was born and raised in Cork. I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science
                    in Computer Science at University College Cork. This website was created in November, December of 2020
                    for my continuous assessment assignment for my Web Development module. The colour scheme and design is inspired by the 
                    Ubuntu Linux distribution. Page transitions were made with Swup.js.

                    <h4>Care less. Be happier.</h4>
                    <p>Easier said than done. Stressing out over things serves no purpose. Just makes you feel worse.</p>
                    <h4>Pineapple on pizza. Bad.</h4>
                    <p>Slimy. Sweet. Gross. Of course if my web dev lecturer likes pineapple on pizza, I take this back.</p>
                    <h4>Golf is boring.</h4>
                    <p>Seriously. How do people watch this stuff? Same disclaimer as above applies here.</p>
                    <h4>Singing in labs is cringe.</h4>
                    <p>I'll never live it down. But all you can do is laugh at that type of thing. Could have been worse.</p>

                    <h4>Debating</h4>
                    <p>I've done debating since I was 13. It was fun but not sure if I'll keep it up during college.</p>
                    <h4>Cooking</h4>
                    <p>I've always found cooking relaxing. My favorite kind of food is Italian. Pasta is unreal.</p>
                    <h4>MMA</h4>
                    <p>I love watching MMA. I did Kickboxing and BJJ for a year before Covid (I'm really bad at both though).</p>
                    <h4>Coding</h4>
                    <p>I don't have major experience but I've messed around with mobile game development.</p>
                    <h4>Music</h4>
                    <p>My favorite genre is hip-hop but I love rock too. I like to listen to Radiohead for labs.</p>
                    <h4>Business</h4>
                    <p>This is an aspiration of mine but I'm definitely not doing software entrepreneurship.</p>
