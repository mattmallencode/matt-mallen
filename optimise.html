<p><strong></strong>The first release from the <strong>Human Body Academy </strong>is a revision guide <strong>Anatomy & Physiology - Ace Your MCQ Exams, The Ultimate Revision Guide. </strong>It <span class="redactor-invisible-space" style="background-color: initial; color: var(--squid-ink);">is a comprehensive bank of multiple choice questions, essential diagrams and definitions for students with upcoming exams. This is not a taught course as others are but rather a self paced resource including over 1000 multiple choice questions divided by the systems of the body . These questions are auto-corrected and may be practiced as often as the student wishes. My reasoning for launching this first is that, in over 27 years of preparing students for exams in  Anatomy & Physiology, practice multiple choice questions were the most requested resource.</span>
