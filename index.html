               I relied heavily on the work of <i>Professor Scott Galloway</i> to write the section (<i>"The Big Four"</i>) of
              this blog post. I'd encourage you to watch this <a data-no-swup href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWBjUsmO-Lw">video lecture</a> of his or to
               check out his <a data-no-swup href="https://www.bookdepository.com/The-Four-Scott-Galloway/9780552173438?redirected=true&utm_medium=Google&utm_campaign=Base1&utm_source=IE&utm_content=The-Four&selectCurrency=EUR&w=AFFPAU9S1LGSJLA8VL48&pdg=pla-293946777986:cmp-10333900495:adg-102993026076:crv-443150513206:pos-:dev-c&gclid=Cj0KCQiAtqL-BRC0ARIsAF4K3WEXV5q7EyrR0An77wvUURm-oyP_7XzSKNOtoyMmzl80ZMjKTRiNgzwaAm97EALw_wcB">book</a> 
              of the same title. They are both excellent.
            </p>
            <p>
              I got a lot of my information from a <a data-no-swup href="https://cdn.ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ILSR_AmazonReport_final.pdf">report</a> by <i>The Institute For Local Self Reliance</i> which I quote directly
              at the end of this post. It's a very good read if you have the time.

             <h3>Amazon by the numbers:</h3>
             <ul class="list bloglist">
                <li>2015: Amazon passed Walmart as the US’ most valuable retailer by market cap. </li>
                <li>In 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market, vastly increasing its presence as a brick-and-mortar retailer. </li>
                <li>Amazon Prime has over 100 million subscribers worldwide. </li>
                <li>Notable Amazon subsidiaries are: Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Audible, Amazon Publishing, Amazon Studios, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Kindle, Echo, Ring, Twitch.tv, Whole Foods & iMDb. </li>
                <li>In the US it accounts for: 4% of retail sales, 24% of retail growth and 44% of e-commerce sales. </li>
                <li>62% of US households have Amazon Prime. Globally it accounts for: 33% of cloud revenue, 55% of black friday sales and 70% of voice home assistants.</li>
                <li>Amazon had 74 private labels as of June 2018</li>
             </ul>
             <h3>The Big Four:</h3>
             <p>
             Last week, I ordered some electronics off Amazon. In a few short days they were delivered right to my door. 
             Once again, my Amazon Prime Membership was fulfilling its function as a pipe of random crap I didn't really need 
             but felt the need to consume straight into my home. Large technology companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon & Apple have deconstructed basic human desires 
             and needs and turned them into commodities, creating unprecedented share holder value as a result. 
             <i>Professor Scott Galloway</i> illustrates this by representing each one of these companies with an Organ. 
            </p>
            <p>
             <b>Google</b> is our Brain, our desire to basically know things about the world around us and how this data can then be monetized. 
             <b>Facebook</b> is our heart, our desire to love and be loved; it provides all of the dopamine kick we get from social interaction 
             without any of the effort and all of the superficial crap.
             <b>Apple</b> is our genitals, our most powerful desire; to propagate our genes: If I own an iPhone or an apple watch
            it communicates a number of things to the opposite sex (or at least a lot of people buy into the idea that it does): 
            I'm likely wealthy, I'm part of the intellectual class, I'm interesting. In short, you should have children with me, 
            our offspring are more likely to survive. This luxury brand appeal has made it the most profitable company on the planet. 
            Then <b>Amazon</b> is our digestive system; the most common cause of death throughout human history has been starvation. 
            It is hard-wired into our DNA that throughout the majority of our evolutionary history that times of abundance have been relatively short, 
            so we should consume as much as possible while we can. Look at all of the random crap you own, you don't need the vast majority of it but your desire to consume propels 
            you onto the Amazon marketplace far more often than you perhaps would like to admit.</p>
            <p>
              I think there's a case to made for all four of these firms to be broken up
              <a data-no-swup href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c">
                <i>Elizabeth Warren</i></a> has made that part of her platform for the Democratic candidacy, 
                I completely agree with this policy position and I recommend that you read it. However, the intricacies of 
                each one of these firms is difficult to articulate in one post. So I'm going to focus the discussion here on the 
                leader of the pack.
            </p>
            <h3>Amazon:</h3>
            <p>
              According to the invisible hand, in 2016 Amazon was worth nearly twice that of Walmart, even though the retail giant 
               raked in $80 billion in profit over the previous 5 years, while Amazon only made $1 billion. It's obviously not its dividends that have caused its 
               share price to sky rocket in an unprecedented fashion. What the market sees in <i>Jeff Bezos</i>, is an executive who has come to dominate multiple industries 
               to the point that he can be relied on to yield monopoly level returns in the coming years.
            </p>
            <p>Amazon obviously shouldn't be broken up just because it's overvalued, it should be broken up because its quickly
               transforming "free markets" into a private market by which it can dictate the terms. It's doing this by providing 
               the underlying systems - the online store, the shipping, logistics, the cloud infrastructure - that its competition 
               depends on to function. If Walmart owned most of the malls and Main Streets in the US, decided the terms by which its competitors 
               could rent these storefronts, and dictated the terms of sale of every single item you bought in those shops there would be a public outcry. 
               Then why, is it that when it comes to the world of e-commerce the electorate and in turn our regulators are eerily quiet?
               In 2018 Amazon announced in a press release that they were “looking at healthcare costs” and the US health care industry 
               shed $30 billion dollars by the markets next opening bell. Amazon knows your BMI based on the clothes sizes you order, 
               they know if you exercise, they know what foods you eat etc so the market knew that they were in a perfect position 
               to be a major player in healthcare. If a company can disrupt a major economic sector just from a single line in a press release,
              <b>the markets aren't working.</b>
              <h3>So why does Amazon suck?:</h3>
              <p>
                <a data-no-swup href="https://mashable.com/2014/07/25/amazon-profit-loss-on-purpose/?europe=true"><i>Amazon retail</i> is a loss maker year-on-year.</a> However since Amazon has other profitable 
                subsidiaries such as their cloud service <i>Amazon Web Services</i> they're able to subsidize those losses which 
                allows them to sell items and provide delivery at a cost. This obviously makes them extremely attractive to 
                consumers and means that start-ups or smaller established competitors will always be crowded out of the market as 
                they can't match Amazon's access to cheap capital. Now you might be saying? What's the harm? Cheap goods equals 
                happy customers. Yes that may be true, but it means that other innovators can't ever enter the marketplace. 
                This below cost model allows them to engage in hostile takeovers of companies that they consider to be a threat. 
                When brands like <i>Diapers.com</i> wanted to enter the e-commerce space; Amazon asked them to sell and when 
                they refused Amazon slashed prices on diapers up to 30% and <a data-no-swup href="https://slate.com/technology/2013/10/amazon-book-how-jeff-bezos-went-thermonuclear-on-diapers-com.html">Diapers.com eventually capitulated and was acquired by the e-e-commerce giant</a>. These hostile takeovers are prolific throughout Amazon's history.
              </p>
              <p>
                Obviously sanitary products for babies aren't the cradle of innovation for the modern consumer but this 
                is a case of what isn't seen, what ideas never get off the ground because the little guy keeps getting squished by Jezz Bezos? 
                If the <a data-no-swup href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.">United States hadn't taken anti-trust action against Microsoft</a> 
                at the turn of the century companies like Google wouldn't have even made it out of their infancy because they wouldn't have been smothered 
                in their crib by the might of big business. This means that a dominant Amazon robs consumers of any innovation that results from competitive markets, 
                <b>prices are not the be all and end all and we need to stop acting like they are.</b>We're
                much more than consumers. We're people who need to earn a living, who want to have meaningful jobs, and 
                who care about the freedom to build a business. Our contribution to the economy should not be forever limited
                to buying cheap crap. Everyone on this planet deserves a fighting chance to be at the wheel of economic
                activity, not just in the passenger seat.</p>
              <p>If you want to shop for something online <a data-no-swup href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/new-report-shows-just-how-significant-amazons-reach-in-ecommerce-is/">most consumers will start with an Amazon search</a> 
                rather than a Google search. This means that they have an unrivaled position on the market and limits the consumer's effective ability to shop around. 
                They are only likely to consolidate this dominance of product search further into the future as they own 
                <a data-no-swup href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/amazon-to-control-70-percent-of-the-voice-controlled-speaker-market-this-year/">70% of the voice AI assistant market</a>, technology that is only becoming more popular and soon will be integrated into people's cars. 
                Your friendly Alexa recommending the Amazon version of any part of the economy you ask about in conjunction with the allure of Prime 
                means that you will get sucked into this ever present Amazon bubble and it's extremely difficult to leave.</p>
                <p>By controlling the web's shopping traffic, Amazon has forced other retailers and producers who want to sell online to reckon with a false choice. 
                  Try your best to draw customers to your own site, even though none of them will use any of the platforms
                  you advertise on for product search; or give up any power you have to the tech giant. Amazon constantly releases
                   <a data-no-swup href="https://www.neweurope.eu/article/eu-competition-targets-amazons-copycat-products/">copy-cat products</a> 
                   of successful items on the store and sells them for cheaper, the inherent problem that's present 
                   when the owner of the platform is permitted to compete on it. This means that if you're a startup 
                   with a cool idea that begins to gain traction you can look forward to Amazon stealing the concept
                   and essentially charging you a tax on any sales you make failing to compete with them since
                   they take a cut of any sales you make</p>
                   <p>The size and influence of companies like Amazon has lead to the political capture of our 
                     politicians and regulators. <a data-no-swup href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/03/why-amazon-paid-no-federal-income-tax.html">
                      Amazon didn't pay a single dollar in federal tax last year.</a> They dictate competition laws, e-book publishers 
                      tried to combine efforts to combat some of Amazon's 
                      <a data-no-swup href="https://mashable.com/2014/07/30/amazon-has-killed-publishers-they-just-dont-know-it-yet/?europe=true">anti-competitive policies</a> 
                      and Amazon successfully pressured the US government to sue them for collusion. They get to crack down on unions, and treat their workers like <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/amazon-drivers-warehouse-conditions-workers-complains-jeff-bezos-bernie-1118849">modern slaves</a>.
                       They don't care in the slightest about your privacy like when they ha a massive data breach of millions of customers 
                       personal data shortly before
                        <a data-no-swup href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2018/11/22/worst-amazon-black-friday-deal-confirmed-as-customer-data-is-leaked/#4cf58ee7548d">black Friday last year</a>. 
                        All it takes is for a bad data breach and everyone knows what Amazon knows about you, which is just about everything.
                         If your in a monogamous relationship, what pharmaceuticals your taking, how much you weigh. 
                         Your dating app is likely hosted on web services so now your neighbor can find out your sexual preferences.
                         And what is our solution to this? Well in the EU 
                         <a data-no-swup href="https://ec.europa.eu/ireland/news/commission-fines-google-1.49-billion-euro-for-abusive-practices-in-online-advertising_en">we give tech giants slaps on the wrist</a>
                         for disregarding the rights of millions of consumers. 
                         We need a lot more government intervention the world of big business - particularly big tech - , we need to empower our regulators to kick them in the teeth when they overstep and drastically limit their lobbying power.
                        <b>Unfortunately this is about as likely as peace on Earth.</b></p>
                        <p>I'm not optimistic about the future to say the very least but I'd like to leave you with a quote from the <i>ISLR Amazon Report</i> that hopefully will inspire you to take some form of action no matter how small.</p>
                        <blockquote>"Jeff Bezos insists that Amazon represents a modern form of commerce, and that to challenge it is to challenge the digital revolution itself. 
                          This is the fox characterizing his efforts on behalf of the hens. What's striking when we look closer is how much this company seems to belong to the Robber Baron age. 
                          Back then, men like Cornelius Vanderbilt and J.P. Morgan harnessed a new technology, the railroad, to stifle competition across multiple industries and extort money 
                          from farmers and small business people who depended on the rail lines. Americans responded by launching the antitrust movement, and it's to the ideas and policies they 
                          brought forward that we should turn today in the face of this new colossus."</blockquote>

        <h2>A-Hitchhiker's-Guide-To-China's-Silk-Road </h2><p class="divider">: </p><p class="date">01-12-2020 </p><p class="divider">$ </p>
        <p class="tagline">Not Chinese. Take with a pinch of szechuan peppercorn.</p>
        <h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
        <p>Whenever I refer to "China" in this blog post or any similar catch-all phrase I'm referring to the <i>Chinese
          Communist Party</i> and/or China as a state. I am <em>not</em> referring to China as a nation or to people from/living there.
        </p>
        <h3>The Middle Kingdom:</h3>
        <p>When Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping began to champion the Belt & Road Initiative as "a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future", 
          foreign policy experts scoffed. The truth was largely self-evident, China has never been an altruistic actor - similar to most major global powers - and was likely 
          adopting <a data-no-swup href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACbbz0rOv6A">this global strategy</a> of massive economic investment, lending and economic integration 
          (primarily focused on trade infrastructure) which could result in a bill of <a data-no-swup href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/china-belt-and-road">$1.3 trillion</a> over its life time to establish itself 
          as the central node of a new Eurasian trade network and to afford it great diplomatic influence. I'm no fan of China, in fact I will say outright that the state is the biggest threat to human liberty on the planet and trumps any other entity when it comes to that metric by a significant margin. 
          I'd only have to point you as a reader to the regime's <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-48700786">treatment of their millions of Uyghurs</a> to begin to substantiate that. 
          I'd like to dissect the common criticisms of this major foreign policy initiative and see if <em>big, bad,</em>China deserves for it to be added to their list of mistakes and outright crimes.</p>
          <h3>What are the characteristics of China as a global actor?:</h3>
          <ul class="list bloglist">
            <li>
              <b>China is expansionist by nature.</b> China has illustrated a pattern of behaviour that clearly shows they have expansionist ambitions. 
              <a data-no-swup href="https://www.thoughtco.com/the-sino-indian-war-1962-195804">As early as the 1960s they went to war with India</a> 
              so they could expand their Himalayan border, a war which also involved Nepal and Bhutan. More recently when trying to consolidate 
              their claim on the <a data-no-swup href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luTPMHC7zHY">nine dash line</a> in the south china sea they've been building 
              artificial islands and moving a massive amount of naval firepower near contested islands as a show of strength.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>China needs to eliminate bottlenecks in its supply chains</b>. China is deeply concerned over the potential for their 
              adversaries to cut them off from natural resources in the event of an international conflict. For example 80% of all crude oil imports into China come 
              through the <a data-no-swup href="https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/strait-of-malacca-key-chokepoint-for-oil-trade">Malacca straits</a>, a central point of failure which if blockaded could 
              grind the Chinese economy to a halt.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>China exploits its investees.</b> Chinese resource extraction operations in <a data-no-swup href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/blessing-curse-understanding-social-impact-chinese-mining-africa/">Africa</a> have been heavily criticised as 
              exploitative and without regard for the local populous and in 2015 after Sri Lanka could not meet their debt obligations for a port they financed with Chinese money, they were<a data-no-swup href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/asia/china-sri-lanka-port.html"> forced to hand over the port </a>
              to the people's republic on a 99 year lease. This <i>"debt trap diplomacy"</i> is a key feature of China's <i>soft power</i> resume.

              <b>China is extremely authoritarian.</b> If the memory of <a data-no-swup href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4woMuFZAx88">Tiananmen square</a> wasn't enough, China recently <a data-no-swup href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/xi-jinping/">
                removed term limits for its paramount leader</a> - effectively making him dictator for life - and has massively cracked down on online dissent and a recent corruption purge targeted many of Xi's opponents in what 
                have been described as extra judicial prosecutions often involving forced confessions under torture.

          <h3>So, the Chinese Communist Party sucks. However: </h3>
          <p>
            To be fair, if I was to do a summary like this of any other major world player. Whether that was the United States or the United Kingdom 
            a fair few of those bullet points would equally apply. Plenty of western nations who developing countries have previously looked to for financing 
            have engaged in expansionist military operations, exploited developing economies and like economic growth. Also, perhaps I'm being too optimistic here,
             but I don't think China investing in Afghanistan, Egypt or Liberia is going to make those countries or China itself any more authoritarian, this global strategy
              and democratic reform aren't mutually exclusive. If anything, having businesses and capital ownership within these countries due to economic growth 
              makes it far <a data-no-swup href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2fnews%2fmonkey-cage%2fwp%2f2014%2f12%2f29%2feconomic-development-promotes-democracy-but-theres-a-catch%2f%3f">more likely for them to be democratized</a>
            <strong>Our assessment of this initiative should consider 1) Has it been good for developing countries and 2) is there a better option than China?</strong></p>
            <h3>Is it a good thing?:</h3>
            <p>
              Well I'll admit the jury still is out on this one and we likely won't have any real idea for several years. 
              <i>"Debt trap diplomacy"</i> sounds pretty evil, but to be fair some of these economic assets China leverages through diplomatic pressure 
              - <em>like the Sri Lankan port</em> - wouldn't have existed without Chinese money in the first place. 
              If infrastructure becomes better throughout Eurasia those construction projects would give millions of people jobs through both direct and indirect employment, 
              would require investment in education for the army of engineers and construction workers you would need to build these infrastructural projects and would lead 
              to real increases in people's purchasing power due to goods being able to be shipped faster, more efficiently and to far reaching places. 
              This means that goods that previously couldn't reach emerging markets, could now be affordable for their expanding middle classes. 
              I'm of the opinion that the 152 countries that have participated in the initiative in one way or another can conduct a risk based analysis of debt vs growth themselves. 
              Now that sounds like a lot of pie in the sky talk, <b>so how has this worked out in real terms?</b>
               <a data-no-swup href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160412093432/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2015-01/29/c_127433046.htm">Between 2014 and 2016, China's total trade volume in the countries along the Belt and Road exceeded $3 trillion, created $1.1 billion revenues and 180,000 jobs for the countries involved. </a>
               So the answer to this question is a very boring: <b>maybe</b>.
               <ul class="list bloglist">
                <li><b><i>The International Monetary Fund.</i></b> The IMF has a history of forcing the implementation of <a data-no-swup href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/may/13/imf-us-congress-aid">ruinous structural economic policies</a> 
                  in exchange for financial aid such as austerity measures that may not be in these nations interests and their operations 
                   are largely dominated by a neo-liberal ideological bent that sometimes makes them too stubborn to correct course when
                    their measures cause more harm than good for the country they're trying to help. Conversely, China has a more immediate interest 
                    in seeing the countries they invest in becoming financially stable as they won't have consumers to sell their goods to on the new silk road 
                    if their loan structures effectively bankrupt them from the bottom up (the middle class often face the biggest squeeze when it comes to the tax burden associated with austerity). 
                    Beyond the differing incentive structure there is also evidence to suggest <a data-no-swup href="https://www.ft.com/content/0b207552-6977-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d">China is a more reasonable debtor.</a></li>
                    <li><b><i>The World Bank.</i></b> This institutions past efforts definitely deserve a lot of praise. From their&nbsp;revitalisation of post war France, their investment in risky capital projects across 
                  the developing world in the twentieth century and their investment in post war Kosovo all truly deserve accolades. However, the world bank is largely a shadow of its former self, this is largely due to an
                   internal policy shift in the early nighties from development to the achievement of western centric progressive goals. <a data-no-swup href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/10/how-the-world-bank-keeps-poor-nations-poor/"></a></li>
                   <li><b>Another nation state.</b> I'll largely talk about the United States here. Bilateral aid from a pro tariff America entering an isolationist trajectory is definitely not something we want to hang our hat on. 
                  Regardless, bilateral aid from western powers has a long history of being used as a weapon to promote their own interests. 
                  (Sounding like two sides of the same coin with China here)</li>
                <li><b>International Markets.</b> there are lots of countries with below <a data-no-swup href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_credit_rating">investment grade sovereign debt ratings</a> that would be unlikely to get investment from international bond markets.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Overall, I think China is either on par or better than these other options.</strong>
                So to wrap up, the CCP are scary. But are they scary because they're building some railways in Pakistan?
              Probably not to the extent that some alarmists would say.</p>
